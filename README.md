# Chatbot-with-Deep-learning
Here i made a chatbot using python using deep learning concept.
The approach is that we have dataset given containing tags and their corresponding context and responses. Then using NLTk we form our bag of words that are required.
Then using ANN we train our model to learn which sentence belong to which tags. Now when our model is trained we take input predict its tag and from the responses mentioned in the dataset a random response is choosen and displayed.
Using tkinter a gui is made for our chatbot.
